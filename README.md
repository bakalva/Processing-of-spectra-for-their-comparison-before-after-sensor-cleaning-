# Processing-of-spectra-for-their-comparison-before-after-sensor-cleaning-
A tool for complex analysis of Raman spectroscopy data before and after purification of sensors with hydrogen peroxide of various concentrations
- Processing of spectral data in the WDF format
- Comparative analysis of the spectra before and after purification
- Calculation of cleaning efficiency by pixels
- Statistical processing of the results
- Visualization of the spatial distribution of efficiency


Main results:
Averaged spectra before and after purification
Efficiency maps by pixels
Statistical reports on concentrations
3D visualization of spatial distribution
Histograms of cleaning efficiency

Cleaning may not be peroxide, for the code to work, you just need the mapping data of any areas so that you can compare them.
